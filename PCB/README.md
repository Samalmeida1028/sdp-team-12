This is a fully reverse-engineered Raspberry Pi Pico H made in KiCad version 8. The Raspberry Pi Foundation publishes lots of information on this board, including the full schematics and board layout files.

Below is a 3D render of my board.  This version is much better than the original prototype we had created for our CDR presentation.  Compared to our original prototype, our second and final revision has more efficiently placed items, incorperates components that are more abundantly available, has rounded edges, and an overall more visually pleasing appearance.
